Comments:

 This is my first distributed skin - "serial experiments lain" has become my favorite
series and I was unhappy with the available skins. I then decided to create my own to
launch along with my new lain webpage. I realize the equalizer is pretty unfunctionable,
but it sure looks nice. Visit http://www3.cybercities.com/l/lain/ for updates, mail your
