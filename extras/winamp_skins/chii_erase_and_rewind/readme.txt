It's Chii-chan's evil half, apparently.  And she looks like she borrowed Kamui's wardrobe, don't you think?


"ERASE/REWIND" - THE CARDIGANS
------------------------------
Hey, what did you hear me say
You know the difference it makes
What did you hear me say
Yes, I said it's fine before
But I don't think so no more
I said it's fine before

I've changed my mind I take it back
Erase and rewind
'Cause I've been changing my mind
I've changed my mind

So where did you see me go
It's not the right way, you know
Where did you see me go
No, it's not that I don't know
I just don't want it to grow
It's not that I don't know

I've changed my mind I take it back
Erase and rewind
'Cause I've been changing my mind

Erase and rewind
'Cause I've been changing my mind

Erase and rewind
'Cause I've been changing my mind

Erase and rewind
'Cause I've been changing my mind

I've changed my mind


Please do not post this skin to other web archives without notifying me first.  I'd really really appreciate it if you asked before you did it.
