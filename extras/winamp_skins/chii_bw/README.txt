Comments:

I rather like the black and white effect used on this skin, albeit it being a bit monotone. The original image was already black and white anyway. It also had a star ornament on top of the chair that Dark Chii is sitting on (I mean, I'm pretty sure it's Dark Chii ....) but it got in the way of the buttons so I erased it, teehee.
